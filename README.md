# Artizandan

At Artizandan, we are building a community-driven food platform. We aim to provide our Artizans (stay-at-home parents, retirees, those with technical skills, and anyone who loves to cook!) with the opportunity to earn income from their own kitchens. We also believe that everyone should have access to healthy, homemade meals at prices lower than those set by restaurants. Building a community dedicated to economic empowerment and cultural inclusivity is why we founded Artizandan.

Artizandan is committed to bringing homemade food back into people's lives, from nostalgic recipes to dishes rarely found in restaurants, just like grandma used to make. At Artizandan, we allow the world to discover recipes passed down from generation to generation and give aspiring new cooks the opportunity to realize their dreams.
